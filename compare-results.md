# Docker vs Remote Results Comparison

## Docker Baseline (âœ… Completed)
```
Memory: 7.7GB total
ClamAV: Working, likely daemon mode
Services: 4/5 healthy (Falco unhealthy)
Audit: Completed successfully
Scan time: ~30 seconds
```

## Remote Results Template
After running `./remote-test.sh`, fill in:

```
Memory: [___] total (expected: ~961MB)
ClamAV Mode: [daemon/direct] (expected: direct)
Services: [___]/5 healthy
Audit Exit Code: [___] (expected: 0)
Scan Log: [created/missing] (expected: created)
OOM Events: [___] (expected: 0)
Scan Time: [___] (expected: < 2 minutes)
```

## Key Success Indicators
- [ ] Memory shows ~961MB (confirms environment)
- [ ] ClamAV uses direct scanning (memory-aware working)
- [ ] Audit completes with exit code 0 (no timeout)
- [ ] Scan log created with progress entries
- [ ] No OOM killer events in dmesg
- [ ] All expected services available
