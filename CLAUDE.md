# Laravel Perimeter Development Notes

## Current Status

We've been working on improving the Laravel Perimeter security package, focusing on:

1. **ClamAV Daemon Issues** ✅ RESOLVED
   - Fixed issues where ClamAV doesn't start properly in production environments
   - Enhanced `ClamAVService::startService()` with better error handling
   - Added `isClamdRunning()` and `ensureDirectoriesExist()` helper methods
   - Added more robust logging for troubleshooting
   - **NEW**: Enhanced permission handling with `ensureClamavUserExists()` method
   - **NEW**: Added configurable timeouts for health checks (`health_check_timeout`)

2. **Test Data Generation** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Removed problematic auto-generation of test security events
   - Enhanced SecurityEventFactory to create more realistic and varied test data
   - Created proper test data files in resources/testdata/ directory
   - Updated PerimeterSeedTestData command to support automatic file copying (removed --force flag)

3. **Timeout Issues** ✅ RESOLVED
   - **Report Command Fix**: `perimeter:report` no longer runs system commands that can timeout
   - **Database-Only Reporting**: Report command now uses direct database queries instead of live scanning
   - **Configurable Timeouts**: Added configurable timeouts for ClamAV and Trivy scans
   - **Production-Friendly Defaults**: Extended timeouts for large codebases in production (1800s/30min)

4. **Health Check Improvements** ✅ RESOLVED
   - **Service-Aware Health Logic**: Optional services no longer show as "Unhealthy" when properly configured
   - **ClamAV Direct Mode**: Reports as healthy when using direct scanning (daemon not required in low-memory environments)
   - **Optional Service Support**: UFW and Fail2ban can be healthy even when not actively running
   - **Production-Ready**: Eliminates false "Unhealthy" alerts that could trigger monitoring systems

5. **Code Quality** ✅ MAINTAINED
   - All package tests passing (55 tests, 274 assertions)
   - All Docker integration tests passing (7 tests, 12 assertions)  
   - All linting checks passing (109 files)

## Recent Changes Made

### ClamAV Service Enhancements (`src/Services/ClamAVService.php`)
- Enhanced `ensureDirectoriesExist()` with better permission handling
- Added `ensureClamavUserExists()` method to create system user if missing
- Uses consistent `isRunningAsRoot()` helper method
- Added configurable `health_check_timeout` (default: 300 seconds)
- Better error logging for permission issues

### Trivy Service Improvements (`src/Services/TrivyService.php`)
- Added configurable `scan_timeout` for vulnerability scans (default: 1800 seconds / 30 minutes)
- Applied to both filesystem scans and system package scans
- Enhanced configuration with proper timeout settings in config file
- More production-friendly defaults for large codebases

### Memory-Aware ClamAV Scanning (`src/Services/ClamAVService.php`)
- **NEW FEATURE**: Automatic detection of low-memory environments (< 1.5GB available)
- **Smart Scanning Mode**: Uses `clamscan` (direct) instead of `clamdscan` (daemon) when memory is insufficient
- **Dynamic Selection**: Checks memory and daemon status before each scan operation
- **Enhanced Logging**: Clear messages indicating which scan method is being used
- **Configurable Thresholds**: `min_memory_for_daemon` setting (default: 1536MB)

### Report Command Fix (`src/Commands/PerimeterReport.php`)
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Report command no longer runs system processes that can timeout
- **Database-Only Approach**: Replaced `ReportBuilder::get()` with direct database queries
- **Eliminated Live Scanning**: Report command now only reads existing data from database
- **Removed Service Status Calls**: Simplified empty events display to avoid timeout-prone service status checks
- Maintains proper separation: reporting = read data, auditing = generate data

### Test Data Improvements (`src/Commands/PerimeterSeedTestData.php`)
- Removed --force option from signature
- Made file copying automatic in seedTestFiles() method
- Enhanced test data generation with more realistic variety

### Parser Cleanup (`src/Parsers/Fail2banOutputParser.php`)
- Removed TEST_ENTRY filtering (lines 147-150)
- Now processes all log entries without artificial filtering

### Health Check Improvements (`src/Data/ServiceStatusData.php`)
- **NEW FEATURE**: Added `functional` parameter to distinguish daemon status from operational capability
- **Service-Aware Logic**: ClamAV reports healthy when using direct scanning mode even if daemon isn't running
- **Optional Service Support**: UFW and Fail2ban can be healthy when properly configured but not actively running
- **Production-Ready**: Eliminates false "Unhealthy" alerts that could trigger monitoring systems
- **Backward Compatible**: Default behavior unchanged for services that don't use functional status

## Configuration Options

You can now configure timeouts in your `config/perimeter.php`:

```php
'services' => [
    'clamav' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'health_check_timeout' => 300, // 5 minutes for health checks
        'scan_timeout' => 1800, // 30 minutes for large scans
        'min_memory_for_daemon' => 1536, // 1.5GB minimum for daemon mode
        'force_direct_scan' => false, // Force direct scanning even if daemon is available
        // ... other config
    ],
    'trivy' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'scan_timeout' => 1800, // 30 minutes for large codebases
        // ... other config
    ],
],
```

## Common Commands

### Testing

```bash
# Run all package tests
composer test

# Run tests in Docker
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec app bash -c "cd /package && composer test"

# Run integration tests
docker-compose exec app php artisan test

# Code linting
composer lint:check
```

### Security Services

```bash
# Check security services health
php artisan perimeter:health

# Run a security audit (generates new data)
php artisan perimeter:audit

# Generate security report (reads existing data - no timeouts)
php artisan perimeter:report

# Monitor real-time events
php artisan perimeter:monitor

# Seed test data for manual testing
php artisan perimeter:seed-test-data
```

### Development

```bash
# Code linting
composer lint

# Code linting check only (no changes)
composer lint:check
```

## Common Paths

- **Security Services**: `src/Services/`
- **Commands**: `src/Commands/`
- **Test Data**: `resources/testdata/`
- **Docker Configuration**: `docker/`
- **Output Parsers**: `src/Parsers/`

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Feature Tests**: Test integration of components
3. **Docker Tests**: Test full functionality in container environment

Always test both locally and in Docker to ensure compatibility across environments.

## Known Issues - RESOLVED

1. ~~**Docker Container Events**: Sometimes the Docker container generates security events on startup. Use `perimeter:seed-test-data` instead of relying on auto-generated events.~~ ✅ RESOLVED
2. ~~**ClamAV Detection**: The EICAR test file may not be properly detected in all environments. Ensure ClamAV database is properly updated.~~ ✅ RESOLVED
3. ~~**Timeout Issues**: Report command was running system processes that could timeout in production.~~ ✅ RESOLVED

## Next Steps

1. ✅ ~~Complete testing for all security services (ClamAV, Fail2ban, Falco, Trivy, UFW)~~
2. ✅ ~~Add more comprehensive integration tests~~
3. ✅ ~~Ensure all Docker tests are passing consistently~~
4. **IN PROGRESS**: Test fixes in remote production environment
5. **PENDING**: Address any remaining production issues discovered during testing

## Questions to Ask After Context Compression

When resuming work after context compression, ask these questions to get back up to speed:

1. **"What was the remote environment output you mentioned you were going to paste for the perimeter commands?"**
   - This will show the current state of services in production
   - Help identify if our timeout and permission fixes are working

2. **"Are there any remaining timeout issues or service startup problems in the remote environment?"**
   - Check if ClamAV daemon is now starting properly
   - Verify if report command is running without timeouts

3. **"What specific perimeter commands did you run and what were the results?"**
   - `php artisan perimeter:health` - service status
   - `php artisan perimeter:report` - should be fast now
   - `php artisan perimeter:audit` - full security scan

4. **"Are there any new errors or issues that appeared after our fixes?"**
   - Check for any regressions from our changes
   - Identify any additional configuration needed

5. **"Do you want to test the configurable timeout settings in your production environment?"**
   - We added `health_check_timeout` and `scan_timeout` configuration options
   - These can be tuned for your specific server performance

6. **"Should we proceed with committing and deploying these fixes?"**
   - All tests are passing (55 package tests + 7 integration tests)
   - Code quality is maintained (109 files pass linting)
   - Ready for production deployment
